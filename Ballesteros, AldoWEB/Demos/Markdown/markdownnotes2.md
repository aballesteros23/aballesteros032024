- **Categorical variables**: Categorical variables assign labels or categories to data, grouping individuals into exclusive categories. Each observation belongs to only one group. For example, in medical records, smoking is a categorical variable with two groups: smoker or nonsmoker. Gender and race are also categorical variables in this context.

- **Quantative Data**: are numerical and represent measurements. In the medical example, age is a quantitative variable, as it takes numerical values like 18 or 80. Weight and height are also quantitative variables.

**Data** consist of individuals and variables that give us information about those individuals. An individual can be an object or a person. A variable is an attribute, such as a measurement or a label
